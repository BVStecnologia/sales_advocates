You have provided us with an unresponsive homepage URL
Your home page submission must be easy to access, easy to understand, and relevant to the app you have submitted for verification.

If you have been flagged for an unresponsive homepage URL, follow these steps to  update your Cloud Console submission with an accessible URL to your homepage:

Go to the OAuth consent screen page for your project. You can find it by updating the following URL with your project ID: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=[PROJECT_ID]

Update the required homepage URL field.

Once the URL is updated, click Prepare for verification at the bottom of the last page.

On the Prepare for verification screen, confirm that the information is correct, then click Submit for verification on the final page.

Helpful tip! This is also a great opportunity to make sure your homepage meets all other app homepage requirements. Doing so will help expedite the remainder of the verification process.
The website you provided as your homepage is not registered to you
We require that you verify the ownership of your application homepage. If you have been flagged for an unverified homepage domain, please proceed with the best option below for your project.

Option 1: Verify your existing app homepage
Follow these instructions to verify the submitted homepage belongs to you. Respond to the email you received to confirm that ownership has been verified.

Option 2: Submit another homepage for verification which has already been verified as registered to you 
If you have an alternative home page for your app hosted on an existing domain that is registered to you, you can resubmit for verification with the verified domain.

Once you have resolved this and all other issues, resubmit your verification request in the Cloud Console with the verified homepage URL.

Important! Only resubmit your verification request once you have addressed all issues with your submission.
The provided homepage URL redirects to a different domain than the one listed on the OAuth consent screen
To avoid ambiguity for users, your app homepage URL must be static and cannot redirect to a different URL or domain. The homepage linked on your consent screen must match the link presented in-browser to a user. 

If your homepage URL has been flagged for redirecting to a different domain, please follow the steps below. 

Update your OAuth consent screen configuration to directly link to your homepage:
Go to the OAuth consent screen page for your project. You can find it by updating the following URL with your project ID: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=[PROJECT_ID]

The provided homepage domain appears to be a shortened or condensed link
To avoid ambiguity for users, the homepage URL linked on your consent screen must match the link presented in-browser. If you provided us with a shortened or condensed link to your homepage, we ask that you update your OAuth consent screen configuration to provide the full domain. For example: https://www.google.com/about is a valid domain; https://www.g.co/about is an invalid domain.

Update your OAuth Consent screen configuration with a non-shortened URL for your app homepage:
Go to the OAuth consent screen page for your project. You can find it by updating the following URL with your project ID: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=[PROJECT_ID]

Respond to the email you received to confirm that your app homepage has been updated.

Option 2: Update your consent screen with a different app homepage that is not behind a login page

Option 3: Host the privacy policy for your app on a domain that belongs to your organization or parent organization.
We understand that some applications adhere to the privacy policy belonging to a parent organization. In these situations, it may not be hosted on the same domain as your application homepage. If this is the case, we ask that the submitted privacy policy explicitly mentions either:

The name of the application
The name of the developer
The name of the organization responsible for development 
If the submitted privacy policy meets these criteria:

There is no need to update your OAuth consent screen configuration. Instead, reply to the email you received confirming that the privacy policy belongs to your parent organization.
